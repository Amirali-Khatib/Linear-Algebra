# Linear Algebra course projects
I've done 3 main projects which are listed below:
* Developing Radial Basis Function Neural Network from scratch to recognize the behavior of sin(x/2)
* Sentiment Analysis of Amazon consumersâ€™ reviews, in which I've utilized a Word2Vec pre-trained model for vectorizing the text and feeding them to classifiers
* Stock prediction using moving average and Least Square method
  
**Note**: I've provided mathematical explanations between the lines of code to clarify the procedure for each of the 3 projects above.
