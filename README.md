# Linear Algebra course projects
I've done 3 main projects which are listed below:
* Developing **Radial Basis Function Neural Network from scratch** to recognize the behavior of sin(x/2)
* **Sentiment Analysis** of Amazon consumersâ€™ reviews, in which I've utilized a **Word2Vec pre-trained model** for vectorizing the text and feeding them to classifiers
* **Stock prediction** using **moving average** and **Least Square** method
  
**Note**: I've provided **mathematical explanations** between the lines of code to clarify the procedure for each of the 3 projects above.

# **Manual Solution slides**
I've provided manual solution slides for each chapter of the course including:
* **1. Chapter 1: Matrices and Gaussian Elimination**
* **2. Chapter 2: Vector Spaces**
* **3. Chapter 3: Orthogonality**
* **4. Chapter 4: Determinants**
* **5. Chapter 5: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
* **6. Chapter 6: Positive Definite Matrices**
